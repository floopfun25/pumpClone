# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### âœ… Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows) OR use GitHub Codespaces/Gitpod
- [ ] Install Solana CLI v1.18.17+
- [ ] Install Anchor CLI v0.31.1+
- [ ] Verify `anchor build` works locally

### âœ… Security & Wallets
- [ ] Generate secure production wallets (NEVER reuse dev wallets)
- [ ] Fund deployment wallet with 10-15 SOL
- [ ] Backup all wallet keypairs securely (offline storage)
- [ ] Set up hardware wallet for large treasury amounts

### âœ… Configuration
- [ ] Configure `.env.production` with mainnet settings
- [ ] Update IPFS credentials (Pinata/Web3.Storage)
- [ ] Set up production RPC endpoint (Helius/QuickNode recommended)
- [ ] Verify all program addresses are correct

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Program Deployment
- [ ] Deploy bonding curve program to mainnet
  ```bash
  ./deploy-mainnet.sh
  ```
- [ ] Verify program deployment on Solscan
- [ ] Update program ID in all configuration files
- [ ] Test program instructions with minimal SOL

### Phase 2: Frontend Configuration
- [ ] Update `.env.production` with deployed program ID
- [ ] Build production frontend
  ```bash
  npm run mainnet:build
  ```
- [ ] Test frontend with production configuration
- [ ] Verify wallet connections work

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- [ ] Create test token with 0.1 SOL
- [ ] Test token creation flow
- [ ] Test buy transactions (small amounts)
- [ ] Test sell transactions
- [ ] Verify IPFS metadata loads correctly
- [ ] Check platform fees are collected

## Production Launch

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up domain and SSL certificate
- [ ] Configure CDN (Cloudflare recommended)
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Configure analytics (PostHog, Google Analytics)
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Security
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Set up DDoS protection
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Review and test all API endpoints
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning

### Database & Backend
- [ ] Configure Supabase for production
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure Row Level Security
- [ ] Test database performance under load
- [ ] Set up database monitoring

## Post-Launch Monitoring

### Day 1 Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor program execution and fees
- [ ] Check transaction success rates
- [ ] Monitor frontend errors and performance
- [ ] Watch for unusual trading patterns
- [ ] Verify all platform fees are collected

### Week 1 Tasks
- [ ] Analyze user behavior and optimize UX
- [ ] Monitor liquidity and trading volumes
- [ ] Check program account balances
- [ ] Review and optimize RPC usage
- [ ] Gather user feedback and iterate

## Quick Reference Commands

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Complete mainnet deployment
npm run mainnet:deploy

# Build only (for testing)
npm run mainnet:build

# Preview production build
npm run preview:production
```

### Monitoring & Maintenance
```bash
# Check program status
solana program show PROGRAM_ID

# Check wallet balances
solana balance WALLET_ADDRESS

# View program logs
solana logs PROGRAM_ID
```

## Emergency Procedures

### If Program Issues Occur
1. Stop frontend deployments immediately
2. Investigate program logs: `solana logs PROGRAM_ID`
3. Check wallet balances for unusual activity
4. Contact Solana validator if needed
5. Prepare program upgrade if required

### If Frontend Issues Occur
1. Rollback to previous working version
2. Check RPC endpoint status
3. Verify environment configuration
4. Monitor error tracking for root cause
